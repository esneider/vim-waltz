waltz.vim
=========

Waltz is a simple plugin to enable window and tab navigation with the Alt key.

You can move through windows with Alt+{Up, Down, Right, Left} and through tabs
with Alt+Shift+{Right, Left}.

Options
-------

### The `g:waltz_leave_insert` option

If true, when triggered from insert mode it will exit and leave the window in
normal mode, before switching windows/tabs.

**Default:** 0

### The `g:waltz_esc_mappings` option

If you find that the mappings are not working in insert mode (but they are ok in
normal mode), you can enable them by setting this option to true. But beware,
you will experience a short delay each time you leave insert mode, due to the
escape sequences mappings.

**Default:** 0

Problems
--------

If you are using Terminal in OSX and the mappings don't work, you should move
to a [decent terminal](http://www.iterm2.com/) (you should do this anyway), or
manually add the escape codes generated by each of Alt+{Up, Down, Right, Left},
Alt+Shift+{Right, Left} in
_Terminal_ > _Preferences_ > _Settings_ > _Keyboard_ > _+_.
