waltz.vim
=========

Waltz is a simple plugin to enable window and tab navigation with the Alt key.

You can move through windows with _Alt_ + { _Up_ - _Down_ - _Right_ - _Left_ }
and through tabs with _Alt_ + _Shift_ + { _Right_ - _Left_ }.

Options
-------

### The `g:waltz_dir_keys` option

If 0, use arrow keys.
If 1, use _h_, _j_, _k_, _l_ keys.
If 2, use both.

**Default:** 0

### The `g:waltz_leave_insert` option

If true, when triggered from insert mode it will exit and leave the window in
normal mode, before switching windows/tabs.

**Default:** 0

### The `g:waltz_esc_mappings` option

If you find that the mappings are not working in insert mode (but they are ok in
normal mode), you can enable them by setting this option to true. But beware,
you will experience a short delay each time you leave insert mode, due to the
escape sequences mappings.

**Default:** 0

Problems
--------

If you are using Terminal in OSX and the mappings don't work, you should move
to a [decent terminal](http://www.iterm2.com/) (definitely give it a try), or
manually add the escape codes generated by each of the key combinations in

_Terminal_ > _Preferences_ > _Settings_ > _Keyboard_ > _+_
